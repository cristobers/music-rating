# Music rating website

Allows users to rate music that they've listened to.

## Oauth2 implementation

The implementation of Oauth2 used in this project is largely lifted from this blog post:
https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/oauth-authentication-with-flask-in-2023

## Setup

Make a `venv` and install all of the packages from the `requirements.txt` within it,
then `bash start.sh` to start the flask web server.
